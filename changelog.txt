### Commit name
 - Data Rentention Test
### Added
 - Code for successful data rention test.
###
 - Description:
	This test demonstrates the following:
	* The ability to read PDF files in a way where we can understand or modify the data.
	* The ability to do this without losing data; rewriting it to a new file shows no loss of data.
	* The ability to locate and extract elements of a PDF file, e.g. a stream object.
	Our next goal is to decompress a stream object of a PDF.
	Note: On next revision, merge Bryan's code into Allan's.
